🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Task 01 – Prodigy InfoTech Internship

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms. It demonstrates how simple regression techniques can be applied to real-world housing data for price estimation.

📌 Overview
📂 Dataset: Kaggle – House Prices

🔧 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

🎯 Goal: Predict house prices and evaluate model performance

🚀 Features
Data cleaning & preprocessing

Feature selection (sqft, bedrooms, bathrooms)

Linear Regression model training

Performance metrics: R² Score, RMSE

Visualizations for insights

📈 Sample Output
✅ R² Score: ~0.72

📉 RMSE: ~32000

🏡 Predicted price for 3-bed, 2-bath, 1500 sqft house: ~$210,000
